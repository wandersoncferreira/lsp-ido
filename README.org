* LSP IDO integration

;; EDIT: this functionality was integrated directly into `lsp-mode` https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/pull/2640  ;)

This package provides an interactive IDO interface to the workspace
symbol functionality offered by ~lsp-mode~. For an alternative
implementation based on ivy, see https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ivy
